       "**Lyric:** Do you hear the people sing    Lost in the valley of the night?    It is the music of a people    Who are climbing to the light.        For the wretched of the earth    There is a flame that never dies.    Even the darkest night will end    And the sun will rise.        They will live again in freedom    In the garden of the Lord.    They will walk behind the plough-share,    They will put away the sword.    The chain will be broken    And all men will have their reward.        Will you join in our crusade?    Who will be strong and stand with me?    Somewhere beyond the barricade    Is there a world you long to see?    Do you hear the people sing?    Say, do you hear the distant drums?    It is the future that they bring    When tomorrow comes!        Will you join in our crusade?    Who will be strong and stand with me?

       "**Lyric:** [Verse 1] Seven o'clock in the evening Watchin somethin' stupid on TV I'm zoned out on the sofa When my wife comes in the room and sees me She says, \"Is this Behind the Music with Lynyrd Skynyrd?\" And I say, \"I don't know Say, \"It's gettin' late, what you wanna do for dinner?\" She says, \"I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry.\" I said, \"Well, you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either But I could eat.\" She said, \"So what do you have in mind?\" I said, \"I don't know. What about you?\" She said, \"I don't care ... if you're hungry, let's eat.\" I said, \"That's what we're gonna do! But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!\" And she says, \"Let me think... What's left in our refrigerator?\" I said, \"Well, there's tuna, I know.\" She said, \"That went bad a week ago!\" I said, \"Is the chili okay?\" She said, \"You finished that yesterday!\" I hopped up and said \"I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?\" She's like, \"Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!\" I'm like, \"No, I said 'delivered.'\" She's like, \"I heard you say 'liver'!\" I'm like, \"I should know what I said...\" She's like, \"Whatever! I just don't want any liver!\" Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID It was just cousin Larry Callin' for the third time today... My wife said, \"Let it go to voicemail.\" I said, \"Okay.\" \"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right! So what d'ya want to do?\" She said, \"Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, \"why don't you?\" And then she said \"Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes... Oh, here's your keys\" I step a little bit closer Say, \"Okay, where ya want to go?\" She says, \"How about The Ivy?\" I said, \"Yeah, well, I don't know... I don't feel like gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food\" She's says, \"Olive Garden?\" I say, \"Nah, I'm not in the mood... And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt\" She says, \"Just forget about it\" I said, \"No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!\" Then I get an idea I say, \"I know what we'll do!\" She says, \"What?\" I say, \"Guess!\" She says \"What?\" I say, \"We're goin' to the drive-thru!\" So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors And we get in those car doors Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat belts As we pull out the driveway Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru! Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru? [Verse 2] Well, here we are In the drive-thru line, me and her Cars in front of us, cars in back of us All just waiting to order There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the window and scream \"Hey! What you trying to do, blind me?\" My wife says \"Maybe we should park... We could just go eat inside.\" I said, \"I'm wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride...\" Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', \"Can I take your order, please?\" I said, \"Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.\" Then my wife says \"Baby, hold on?I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time\" I said, \"You always get a cheeseburger!\" She says, \"That's not what I'm hungry for.\" I put my head in my hands and scream \"I don't know who you are anymore!\" The voice on the speaker says \"I don't have all day!\" I said, \"Then take our order And we'll be on our way! I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger, too\" She's like, \"You want onions on that?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I already said that I do... Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it! And two medium root beers No, just one?we'll split it.\" Then I said \"I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright... So read me back my order Let's make sure you got it right.\" She says \"One?you want a chicken sandwich Two?you want a cheeseburger Three?curly fries, and a large root beer\" \"Stop! Don't go no further!\" \"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!\" Then she says \"We're havin' a special I supersized you at no charge.\" \"Oh.\" And that's all I could say, was \"Oh.\" And she says \"Now there is somethin' else That I really think you should know You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more...\" I say \"Great, except we're in the drive-thru... So what would I want that for?\" Then she says \"Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul? And my wife is all like \"No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?\" She says \"Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him last year And I copied off of him in Geometry\" I said, \"I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe.\" And she says, \"Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed to know!\" And then we both were quiet And things got real intense Then she says \"Next window, please That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!\" So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I turned on the radio... [Black Dog by Led Zeppelin] Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat there quietly for her sake Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said \"Um I think you have somethin' in your teeth.\" She turned away from me And then turned back and said \"Did I get it?\" I said \"Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it... But hey, ya know, don't sweat it.\" Then she said \"How about now?\" I said \"Yeah, almost There's still a little bit there, but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast.\" Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I can't believe there's no wallet! [Verse 3] And the lady at the window's like \"Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two\" I turn around to my wife and say \"How much have you got on you?\" She just rolls her eyes and says \"I'll pay for this, I guess\" So she reaches into her purse And busts out the American Express I hand it to the lady And she says \"Oh, dear It's gotta be cash only We don't take credit cards here\" I took back the card and said \"Gee, really? Well, that sucks\" And that's when I found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks I said, \"I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today\" She says, \"I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?\" And I said, \"Never mind Just help me to find some change...\" Now the lady at the window Is lookin' at me kind of strange... And she says, \"Mister, please We gotta move this line along\" I said, \"Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady! We won't be long\" So I looked around inside the glove-box And checked the mat beneath my feet I found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up and says \"You're still about a dollar short\" And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, \"You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!\" And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, \"Okay Forget the chicken sandwich then\" So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man, I just can't wait to eat And now we see this acne-ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that says \"Hello, my name is Eugene\" And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him, \"Hey, Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?\" Well, he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, \"I'm sorry! What did you want again?\" I say \"Ketchup!\" And he says, \"Oh, yeah, that's right... I just spaced out there for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight.\" And then he hands me the ketchup And now we're finally drivin' away And the food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say \"Baby, gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!\" So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger And I pick up the burger And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it They forgot the onions!\n",

Very, very soon One of them will be all mine Guys with nametags walking down the aisles Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles All arranged alphabetically And they're doing a promotional stunt There's a great big purple sign out front That says every 27th customer Will get a ball peen hammer free  [Chorus] I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when) When are they gonna open up that door?

Yo  [Verse 1] Remote is ready, eyes wide, palms are sweaty There's Flintstones on the TV already, Wilma and Betty No virgin to channel surfin', and I'm HD ready So I flip, garbage is all I'm getting There's Simon Cowell, who folks wanna disembowel He opens his mouth, always says something foul They're dying wow, wannabes are crying now He votes 'em out, time to throw in the towel Shows based on reality, oh the humanity Oh, Ozzy's family sure loves profanity Woah, the insanity, oh, dogs that crap and pee Home of depravity? No, they live happily Yo, plus Da Ali G Show, and Celebrity Mole Oh there's Anna Nicole, she's scarin' me Look, Ma ? No cavities! Oh, it's a station break Better go out to the kitchen and microwave something [Chorus] You're gonna lose your mind watching TV They told me, they'd scold me, but I'd still tune into every show My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO The Travel Channel, Discovery and Lifetime You're gonna lose your mind watching TV They told me, cajoled me, \"Turn off those music videos!\" I'm gonna watch C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO The History Channel, and QVC, and Lifetime You're gonna...

True Hollywood Story The rise and decline of twelve actors named Corey Shows for next fall, they've already been namin' CSI: Boise, and Touched by an Uncle Both sound pretty lame, and So does Everybody Tolerates Raymond And King of Queens jumped the shark the first minute I can't believe Richard Simmons ain't in it I move right on to 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter Then I bet I watch The Bachelorette Followed by Welcome Back, Kotter And The Muppet Show where they go \"Mahna Mahna\" [Chorus] You're gonna lose your mind watching TV They told me, they'd scold me, but I'd still tune into every show (oh) My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO The Disney Channel and A&E and Lifetime You're gonna lose your mind watching TV They told me, cajoled me, but I still love Lisa Kudrow (oh) I'm lookin at C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO The Playboy Channel, and Court TV, and Lifetime You're gonna...  [Verse 3] Never miss Melrose Place or Lost in Space I've seen each Amazing Race and Without a Trace But I only watched Will & Grace, one time, one day Wish I hadn't, 'cause TiVo now thinks I'm gay Oh, and Fear Factor, I watched maybe a half hour After that, felt like I needed a long shower Network execs with naked ambition Next week on FOX watch lions eat Christians Like to tie up those programming planners Make them watch all that junk until their heads explode just like Scanners Leech-covered, grub-eating fools on Survivor Look, there's James Lipton discussing the oeuvre Of Mr. Rob Schneider And there's Gilligan and SpongeBob Plus there's MacGyver And Jay Leno has got Madonna Hey, there's Luke Perry And a special all Pig Latin episode of Drew Carey Wanna turn on ET 'Cause I'm a gossip freak And I gotta know who J-Lo is marrying this week A 30-second spot Welcome back to Are You Hot?

Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique!  Your laptop is a month old? Well, that's great If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight My digital media is write-protected Every file inspected, no viruses detected I beta tested every operating system Gave props to some, and others? I dissed'em While your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin' It does all my work without me even askin' Got a flat-screen monitor, 40\" wide I believe that yours says, \"Etch-A-Sketch\" on the side In a 32-bit world, you're a 2-bit user You've got your own newsgroup, alt.total-loser Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax Where'd you get your CPU, in a box of Cracker Jacks?
